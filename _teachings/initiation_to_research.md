## Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to the quantum mechanical origin of chemical bonding and relevant energetics:

- Revision of quantum mechanical description of hydrogen atom 
- Learning the principles of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) and use it to understand bonding in simple homonuclear molecules (F<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>)
- Use of quantum chemistry software ChemCompute which uses density functional theory as a kernel
- Compute combustion energies of common organic molecules and compare then with hydrogen
- Compute energy stored in photo-switching molecules such as azobenzene

## Prerequisites

- None
